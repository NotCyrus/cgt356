<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Cyrus. I am a Senior in the Computer Graphics Technology major at Purdue University. <br> I am studying Web Development. I like to spend time with my dog, read, and play video games for fun. </p>
<h2>Current Programming Knowledge</h2>
<p>I have taken CGT 141, so I have some experience in HTML and CSS. I can make basic web pages, and organize them.<br>
I have a limited knowledge of Javascript from CGT 345, although most of the scripting in the class was done in c#.<br>
I also have some experience in object oriented programming, specifically Java.</p>
<h2>Things I would like to learn from this class</h2>
<p>I would like to learn how to make interactive web pages, as well as pages that will display correctly on mobile devices.</p>
